{-| This module provides all the tools necessary to create modular components
that manage their own effects. **It is very important that you go through
[this tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/elm-components).** It describes a
pattern that is crucial for any of these functions to make sense.

-- EFFECTS

{-| Represents some kind of effect. Right now this library supports tasks for
arbitrary effects and clock ticks for animations.
-}
type Effects msg
    = Task (Task.Task Errorless msg)
    | Tick (Float -> msg)
    | None
    | Batch (List (Effects msg))


{-| A type that has no members. There are no values of type `Errorless`, so if
something has this type, it is a guarantee that it can never happen. It is
useful for demanding that a `Task` can never fail.
-}
type Errorless = Errorless Errorless


none : Effects msg
none =
    None


{-| Turn a `Task` into an `Effects` that results in a `msg`.

Normally a `Task` has a error type and a success type. In this case the error
type is `Errorless` meaning that you must provide a task that never fails. Lots of
tasks can fail (like HTTP requests), so you will want to use `Task.toMaybe`
and `Task.toResult` to move potential errors into the success type so they can
be handled explicitly.
-}
task : Task.Task Errorless msg -> Effects msg
task =
    Task


{-| Request a clock tick for animations. This function takes a function to turn
the current time into a `msg` that can be handled by the relevant component.
-}
tick : (Float -> msg) -> Effects msg
tick =
    Tick


{-| Create a batch of effects. The following example requests two tasks: one
for the userâ€™s picture and one for their age. You could put a bunch more stuff
in that batch if you wanted!

    init : String -> Transaction Message Model
    init userID =
        request (batch [ task (getUserPicture userID), task (getAge userID) ])
          { id = userID
          , picture = Nothing
          , age = Nothing
          }
-}
batch : List (Effects msg) -> Effects msg
batch =
    Batch


map : (a -> b) -> Effects a -> Effects b
map func effect =
  case effect of
    Task task ->
        Task (Task.map func task)

    Tick tagger ->
        Tick (tagger >> func)

    None ->
        None

    Batch effectList ->
        Batch (List.map (map func) effectList)


{-| Convert an `Effects` into a task that cannot fail. When run, the resulting
task will send a bunch of messages to the given `Address`.

Generally speaking, you should not need this function, particularly if you are
using [start-app](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/start-app/latest).
It is mainly useful at the very root of your program where you actually need to
give all the effects to a port. So in the common case you should use this
function 0 times per project, and if you are doing very special things for
expert reasons, you should probably have either 0 or 1 uses of this per
project.
